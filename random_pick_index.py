"""Pick the index of the target. Randomly (uniformly) return one if duplicated.

    << [1, 1, 2, 3, 1], target = 1
    => 0|1|4

Reservoir Sampling:

    Pick the ith line with the probability 1/i.
    
    For example, given a stream data [1, 2, 3â€¦]

    Pick 1: 1 * 1/2 * 2/3 = 0.3333 (pick first * not be replaced by 2 * not be replaced by 3)
    Pick 2: 1/2 * 2/3 = 0.3333 (pick second * not be replaced by 3)
    Pick 3: with 1/3 = 0.3333 

Require Space O(1). The intuition behinds this is for stream data.
