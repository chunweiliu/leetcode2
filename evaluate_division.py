"""Given equations, evaluate functions

     Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.
     Evalutate a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
     => [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].

    - Build a graph then traversal using DFS:

       2     3
    a -<- b -<- c
          |
       4  |
    d -<--      

    Why DFS?
    A. Compute products easier
    
    * Check if the equation was not provided
    * Deal with path with empty result

    - Another way is Floydâ€“Warshall

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
